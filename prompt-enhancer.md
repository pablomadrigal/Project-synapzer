**Act as a world-class prompt engineer.**

**Your task is to analyze the user's [Basic Prompt] and transform it into a "perfect" prompt. This means the new prompt should be clear, concise, and structured to elicit the best possible response from an AI model.**

**Here is the user's basic prompt:**

"[INSERT YOUR BASIC PROMPT HERE]"

**Now, follow these steps to create the perfect prompt:**

**1. Identify the Core Goal:**
   - What is the user's ultimate objective?
   - What specific outcome are they looking for?

**2. Define the Persona:**
   - What role should the AI adopt to best fulfill the request? (e.g., "Act as a travel guide," "You are a senior copywriter," "Assume the persona of a historian.")

**3. Specify the Return Format:**
   - How should the output be structured? (e.g., a list, a table, JSON, a markdown-formatted article).
   - Should there be specific sections or headings?
   - Is there a desired length or word count?

**4. Add Context and Constraints:**
   - What background information is essential for the AI to know? (This is your "Context Dump").
   - Are there any "warnings" or things the AI should avoid? (e.g., "Do not include information about X," "Ensure the tone is professional," "The output should be suitable for a beginner.").
   - What are the key constraints? (e.g., "within a 2-hour drive," "must be lesser-known," "focus on budget-friendly options.").

**5. Provide Examples (if applicable):**
   - Include a or two examples of the desired output to guide the AI's response. This is one of the most effective ways to improve accuracy.

**6. Refine and Clarify:**
   - Rephrase any ambiguous language.
   - Use clear and direct instructions.
   - Number the steps or use bullet points for clarity.

**7. Synthesize into the "Perfect Prompt":**
   - Combine all the elements above into a single, comprehensive prompt.

**Here is an example of a "Perfect Prompt" based on your provided image:**

"**Act as a local hiking expert and travel guide for the San Francisco Bay Area.**

**Your task is to provide a list of the top 3 best medium-length hikes within a 2-hour drive of San Francisco. These hikes should be lesser-known and offer a cool and unique adventure.**

**For each hike, you must return the following information in a clear, easy-to-read format:**

* **Hike Name:** (As it would be found on AllTrails)
* **Starting Address:**
* **Ending Address:**
* **Drive Time from SF:**
* **Hike Distance:**
* **Hike Duration:**
* **What Makes it a Cool and Unique Adventure:**

**Important Considerations:**

* **Be careful to ensure that the name of the trail is correct, that it actually exists, and that the time is correct.**
* **Context:** My girlfriend and I hike a ton! We've done pretty much all of the local SF hikes, whether that's Presidio or Golden Gate Park. We definitely want to get out of town -- we did Mount Tam pretty recently, the whole thing from the beginning of the stairs to Stinson - it was really long and we are definitely in the mood for something different this weekend! Ocean views would still be nice. We love delicious food. One thing I loved about the Mt. Tam hike is that it ends with a celebration (Arriving in town to breakfast!) The old missile silos and stuff near Discovery Point is cool but I've just done that hike probably 20x at this point. We won't be seeing each other for a few weeks (she has to stay in LA for work) so the uniqueness here really counts."

**Now, please generate the "perfect" prompt based on the user's [Basic Prompt] prompt:**
